# Atoll Unreal Engine Project
Atoll is a first person platformer created in Unreal Engine by myself and 3 other teamates.
All assets/models were created by the team. This is a website to display information 
about the game as well as display the development logs created and submitted by using a discord bot
along with the MERN stack.
